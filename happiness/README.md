# Happiness Dataset Analysis

## 1. Introduction

The **Happiness Dataset** consists of **2,363 rows** and **11 columns**, capturing various factors that contribute to subjective well-being across different regions and timeframes. The dataset includes **10 numeric features** and **1 categorical feature**, providing a comprehensive perspective on how elements like economic status, health, and social support correlate with reported happiness. 

### Key Characteristics
- **Rows**: 2,363
- **Columns**: 11 (10 numeric, 1 categorical)
- **Types**: Geographic, regression, high-dimensional

### Analysis Scope
This analysis aims to uncover insights into the factors that influence happiness, examine correlations between these factors, and identify patterns that can guide future research and policy-making.

## 2. Methodology

To analyze the dataset, we employed several techniques that complement each other effectively:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: To summarize the numeric features and identify outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: To find relationships between happiness and other numeric features.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction and to visualize clustering within the dataset.
- **K-means Clustering**: To group similar observations, highlighting patterns among different regions.

### Rationale for Techniques
These techniques were selected to provide a holistic view of the data:
- **Descriptive Statistics** offer a clear understanding of the data distribution and central tendencies.
- **Correlation Analysis** identifies significant relationships that inform policy implications.
- **PCA** reduces dimensionality while retaining variance, making complex data more interpretable.
- **Clustering** highlights distinct groupings, revealing underlying structures within the data.

## 3. Key Findings

### Most Significant Discoveries
- **Life Ladder** (subjective well-being) correlates strongly with economic and social factors:
  - **Log GDP per capita**: Correlation of **0.784**
  - **Social support**: Correlation of **0.723**
  - **Healthy life expectancy**: Correlation of **0.715**

### Statistical Evidence
- The mean **Life Ladder** score is **5.48** (on a scale from 1 to 10), indicating a moderate level of happiness across the dataset.
- **Negative Affect** shows a strong negative correlation with **Life Ladder** at **-0.70**.

### Visual Insights from Charts
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays the relationships between numeric features, highlighting that as **Log GDP per capita** and **Healthy life expectancy** increase, so does the **Life Ladder** score.
- **Clustering PCA**: Reveals four distinct clusters, indicating varied experiences of happiness across different regions.
- **Outliers Boxplot**: Suggests that while **Healthy life expectancy** is perceived positively, other factors like **Social support** may need improvement.

### Unexpected Patterns
- A significant number of outliers were found in **Perceptions of corruption** (194 outliers, **8.21%**), indicating that perceptions of governance could greatly skew overall happiness metrics.

## 4. Implications

### What These Findings Mean
The analysis illustrates that well-being is influenced by a combination of economic prosperity, social support, and health. Negative feelings and perceptions of corruption detract from overall happiness.

### Actionable Insights
- **Policy Recommendations**: Investing in social support systems and health care could enhance overall happiness scores in various regions.
- **Public Awareness**: Addressing perceptions of corruption could improve overall life satisfaction.

### Potential Applications
- This analysis can guide governments and organizations in developing strategies aimed at improving citizen well-being.
- The findings can be utilized in predictive modeling to assess the impact of economic changes on happiness.

### Areas for Further Investigation
- Explore the impact of cultural factors on happiness across different regions.
- Investigate the long-term trends in happiness and how external events (e.g., economic crises) may influence perceptions over time.

## Predictive Potential

The dataset is suitable for machine learning applications, with several promising approaches:
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Quantile Regression**

### Data Quality
- **Completeness**: **98.5%** of records are complete.
- **Consistency**: Data appears consistent across observations.

#### Recommendations
- Consider handling any missing values to enhance predictive accuracy.
